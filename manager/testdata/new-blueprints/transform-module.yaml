# This is an example of a module that configures an already existing arrow-flight service.
# The configuration happens via the specified helm chart. The helm chart may contain e.g.
# a configmap with configuration that gets loaded by the service. Or possibly also a pod
# that executes a curl command to configure the service via REST.
# This service handles all the actions within the cluster.
# The helm chart translates between M4D taxonomy (e.g. names of actions) and the service
# specific syntax.
# Actions have to be specified in M4D specific taxonomy so that the application controller knows
# which functionality this module provides. (e.g. it redacts columns and removes columns)
