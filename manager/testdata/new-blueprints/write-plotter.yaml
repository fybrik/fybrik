  # The syntax is reversed to argo as the default for m4d is parallel workflows.
  # Two dashes start a new parallel action and the sub-flows with one dash are the in-path dataflows.
  # flow 01 reads the data asset and offers it on an interface
  # flow 02 reads the data asset from flow 01, applies actions and offers it to the application
  # flow 03 takes data written out as data asset "out1" to the arrow flight service and stores it on S3
  # flow 04 takes data written out as data asset "out1" to an arrow flight service and does a misuse detection on it
  #
  # Networking modules
  # Open questions:
  # - Should the global modules be generated during blueprint creation or should they be part of the flow and output
  #     of the policy compiler/optimizer?
  # - should there be a proxy that the user writes to that forwards data to step 03 and 04?
