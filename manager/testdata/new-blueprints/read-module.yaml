# This is an example of a module that configures an already existing arrow-flight service.
# The configuration happens via the specified helm chart. The helm chart may contain e.g.
# a configmap with configuration that gets loaded by the service. Or possibly also a pod
# that executes a curl command to configure the service via REST.
# For this example let's assume that the helm chart deploys config maps that are read by the
# service. Once the configuration is loaded the service sets a label "configured: SUCCESS" in
# this configmap. If the service could not be configured the label will be "configured: FAILED".
# An error message will be set in the 'error' annotation.
# This service handles all the reads within the cluster.
