      description: M4DApplication provides information about the application being used by a Data Scientist, the nature of the processing, and the data sets that the Data Scientist has chosen for processing by the application. The M4DApplication controller (aka pilot) obtains instructions regarding any governance related changes that must be performed on the data, identifies the modules capable of performing such changes, and finally generates the Blueprint which defines the secure runtime environment and all the components in it.  This runtime environment provides the Data Scientist's application with access to the data requested in a secure manner and without having to provide any credentials for the data sets.  The credentials are obtained automatically by the manager from an external credential management system, which may or may not be part of a data catalog.
