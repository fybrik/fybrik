# Fybrik

[Fybrik](https://fybrik.io/) is a cloud native platform to control the usage of data within an organization and thus enable business agility while securing enterprise data. Fybrik encapsulates a containerized workload and intermediates all data flows both into the workload and out of the workload, enabling enforcement of policies defining what can be done with the data.
